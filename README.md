Projects While Learning C++

## AmateurEncryption.cpp
Given a stored 5-digit PIN number in a static array, prompts the user to enter their PIN mapped to random integers and verifies if their encrypted PIN is correct.

## CalculateGeometricMean.cpp
Two versions of a program that reads a sequence of positive integers from the user then calculates and prints their geometric mean.

## Censorship.cpp
Prompts the user for a line of text and outputs the line with all the digits in all integer numbers replaced with 'x'.

## Decimal2Binary.cpp
Reads from the user a positive integer (decimal representation) and prints its binary representation.

## DynamicPinetree.cpp
Prints a ‘pine tree’ consisting of triangles of increasing sizes, filled with a character (eg. ‘*’ or ’+’ or ‘$’ etc). Interacts with the user to read the number of triangles in the tree and the character filling the tree.

## IsPalindrome.cpp
Prompts a word from the user and announces to the user if the given word is or is not a palindrome.

## MoreEvenThanOdd.cpp
Prompts the user to input a positive integer n, and prints all numbers from 1 to n that have nmore even digits than odd digits.

## PerfectAmicableNumbers.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer M (>= 2) and prints all the perfect numbers between 2 and M and all pairs of amicable numbers between 2 and M.

## PrintDivisors.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer (>= 2) and prints all its divisors.

## PrintHourglass.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer n and prints a textual image of an hourglass made of 2n lines with asterisks.

## PrintMonthlyCalendar.cpp
Prompts the user for an integer that represents a year and an integer that represents the day in the week of January 1st for that year (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.). Prints a formatted yearly calendar given the user input.

## ReverseArrayRemoveOddSplitParity.cpp
Contains three methods:
### reverseArray
Takes a static array of integers and its size. When called, it reorders the elements of the array to appear in a reverse order.
### removeOdd
Takes a static array of integers and its size. When called, the function alters the array so that the only numbers in it at the end are the even ones, which should remain in their original relative order.
### splitParity
Takes a static array of integers and its size. When called, the function changes the order of numbers in the array so that all the odd numbers will appear first, and all the even numbers will appear last.
