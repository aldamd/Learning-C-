Projects While Learning C++

## CalculateGeometricMean.cpp
Two versions of a program that reads a sequence of positive integers from the user then calculates and prints their geometric mean.

## Decimal2Binary.cpp
Reads from the user a positive integer (decimal representation) and prints its binary representation.

## DynamicPinetree.cpp
Prints a ‘pine tree’ consisting of triangles of increasing sizes, filled with a character (eg. ‘*’ or ’+’ or ‘$’ etc). Interacts with the user to read the number of triangles in the tree and the character filling the tree.

## MoreEvenThanOdd.cpp
Prompts the user to input a positive integer n, and prints all numbers from 1 to n that have nmore even digits than odd digits.

## PerfectAmicableNumbers.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer M (>= 2) and prints all the perfect numbers between 2 and M and all pairs of amicable numbers between 2 and M.

## PrintDivisors.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer (>= 2) and prints all its divisors.

## PrintHourglass.cpp
Prompts the user for a positive integer n and prints a textual image of an hourglass made of 2n lines with asterisks.

## PrintMonthlyCalendar.cpp
Prompts the user for an integer that represents a year and an integer that represents the day in the week of January 1st for that year (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.). Prints a formatted yearly calendar given the user input.
